# CxBKT

This is C++ port of the xBKT software from the Computational Approach to Human Learning labratory at UC Berkeley. Its purpose is to take in observations of student correct or incorrect responses after viewing resources in a given order, and determine the Bayesian probability that the resource caused them to learn the correct answer.

The CAHL xBKT is written in Matlab, a proprietary software requiring expensive licenses. However, most of the heavy computation is done in C++ helper functions. In order to make the program more accessible, this project has been made to make a Matlab-free xBKT in C++.
